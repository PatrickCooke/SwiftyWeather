SwiftyWeather - simple iOS weather app


SwiftyWeather is a simple weather app to be used for just weather updates. I created it for myself and friends, so it is currently on the iTunes App Store.

The idea is to provide useful weather information as quick as possible. It provides more info than the Apple weather app, but doesn't include adds and video links like the weather channel app.

If you have any suggestion to make this app better, I'm still developing it and I'm happy to collaborate.
